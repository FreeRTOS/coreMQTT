# Change Log for coreMQTT Client Library

## v1.0.0 (September 2020)

This is the first release of an coreMQTT client library in this repository.

The MQTT library is a client-side implementation that is compliant with the [MQTT 3.1.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html).   It is optimized for resource-constrained devices, and does not allocate any memory.
