# Change Log for MQTT Client Library

## v1.0.0 (September 2020)

This is the first release of an MQTT client library in this repository.
The MQTT library is a client-side implementation of the [MQTT 3.1.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html) that is optimized for resource-constrained devices, and does not allocate any memory.
