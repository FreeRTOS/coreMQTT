@page mqtt_porting Porting Guide
@brief Guide for porting MQTT to a new platform.

A port to a new system must provide the following components:
1. [Configuration Macros](@ref porting_config)
2. [Transport Interface](@ref porting_transport)
3. [Time Function](@ref porting_time)

@section porting_config Configuration Macros
@brief Settings that must be set as macros in the config header `mqtt_config.h`, or passed in as compiler options

@see [Configurations](@ref mqtt_config)

@note Regardless of whether the following macros are defined in `mqtt_config.h` or passed as compiler options,
the `mqtt_config.h` file must be included to build the MQTT library.

The following macros can be configured for the managed MQTT library:
 - @ref MQTT_STATE_ARRAY_MAX_COUNT <br>
 - @ref MQTT_PINGRESP_TIMEOUT_MS <br>
 - @ref MQTT_MAX_CONNACK_RECEIVE_RETRY_COUNT

In addition, the following logging macros are used throughout the library:
 - @ref LogError
 - @ref LogWarn
 - @ref LogInfo
 - @ref LogDebug

@section porting_transport Transport Interface
@brief The MQTT library relies on an underlying transport interface API that must be implemented
in order to send and receive packets on a network.

@see [Transport Interface](@ref transport_interface)

The transport interface API used by MQTT is defined in @ref transport_interface.h.
A port must implement functions corresponding to the following functions pointers:
 - [Transport Receive](@ref TransportRecv_t): A function to receive bytes from the network.
 @code
 int32_t (* TransportRecv_t )( 
     const NetworkContext_t * pNetworkContext, void * pBuffer, size_t bytesToRecv
 );
 @endcode
 - [Transport Send](@ref TransportSend_t): A function to send bytes over a network.
 @code
 int32_t (* TransportSend_t )(
     const NetworkContext_t * pNetworkContext, const void * pBuffer, size_t bytesToSend
 );
 @endcode

The above two functions take in a pointer to a @ref NetworkContext_t, the typename of a
`struct NetworkContext`. The NetworkContext struct must also be defined by the port, and 
ought to contain any information necessary to send and receive data with the @ref TransportSend_t
and @ref TransportRecv_t implementations, respectively:
@code
struct NetworkContext {
    // Fields necessary for the transport implementations, e.g. a TCP socket descriptor.
};
@endcode

@section porting_time Time Function
@brief The MQTT library relies on a function to generate millisecond timestamps, for the
purpose of calculating durations and timeouts, as well as maintaining the keep-alive mechanism
of the MQTT protocol.

@see @ref MQTTGetCurrentTimeFunc_t

Platforms must supply a function capable of generating 32 bit timestamps of millisecond resolution.
These timestamps need not correspond with any real world clock; the only requirement is that the
difference between two timestamps must be an accurate representation of the duration between them,
in milliseconds.

@note Should the platform be incapable of providing millisecond timestamps, the port may instead
provide a function that always returns 0, or a strictly non-decreasing sequence. In this case, the
timeout values in all library calls to @ref MQTT_Connect, @ref MQTT_ProcessLoop, or @ref MQTT_ReceiveLoop
MUST be set to 0, resulting in loop functions running for a single iteration, and @ref MQTT_Connect
relying on @ref MQTT_MAX_CONNACK_RECEIVE_RETRY_COUNT to receive the CONNACK packet.
