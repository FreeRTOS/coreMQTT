# MQTT Client Library

This repository contains an ISO C90 compliant MQTT client library designed for embedded platforms.

## Building Library and Unit Tests.

### Prerequisites

- For building the library, CMake 3.13.0 or later and a C90 compiler.
- For running unit tests, Ruby 2.0.0 or later is additionally required for the CMock test framework (that we use).
- For running the coverage target, gcov is additionally required.

### Build Steps

1. Go to the root directory of this repository.

1. Create build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

1. Run *cmake* while inside build directory: `cmake .. `

1. Run this command to build the library and unit tests: `make all`

1. The generated library will be present in `build/lib`, and the test executables will be present in `build/bin/tests`.

1. Run `ctest` to execute all tests and view the test run summary.

## Reference examples

The AWS IoT Embedded C-SDK repository contains demos of using the MQTT client library [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/development/demos/mqtt) on a POSIX platform. These can be used as reference examples for the library API.
